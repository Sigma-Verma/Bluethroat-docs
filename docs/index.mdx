# Executive Summary

This document is a practical security guide for teams building Web3 protocols with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Throughout the document, we use the terms **TEEs** and **enclaves** interchangeably, even though, strictly speaking, cloud "enclaves" (like AWS Nitro) are *not* full TEEs in the academic sense. This distinction matters, but for real-world engineering, the threat models and failure modes overlap enough to treat them together.

This is **NOT** an academic resource. It is intentionally biased toward *practical, operational, and implementation-level security*, which are exactly the things that actually break in production. This guide is written for **TEE security engineers**, not TEE cryptography researchers. The focus is on the Web3 ecosystem specifically; there may be many TEE resources out in the world, but this document does not attempt to survey or replicate them. Our only goal is to analyse how TEEs fail **in Web3**, and how protocols can build secure, verifiable, and economically robust systems despite those failures.

Some of the things we will touch upon:

- deep dive into the architecture of the most famous TEE infra offering in web3
- how the threat landscape changes when TEEs move into cloud environments,
- the most common and most dangerous TEE failure modes in Web3, and
- a layered blueprint for building secure architectures (TEE + Attestation + Constant-time crypto + MPC + ZK + Governance).
