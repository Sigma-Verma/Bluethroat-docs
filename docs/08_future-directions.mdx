# Future Directions

## Bluethroat Labs: Who are we?

We are a technical collective that studies TEEs. We study how they're built, how they break, and how to make them more reliable.

## Vision for this document

*To make this document the gold standard for practical security around TEEs.*

Any web3 protocol that leverages TEEs in any capacity should be able to get significant help from this document on TEE security.

## Future of this document

This document is and will remain a *living resource*. The TEE security landscape shifts rapidly: new hardware revisions and exploits, cloud platform changes, attestation updates, and emerging side-channel research can alter threat models quickly. For a technology as critical and as misunderstood as TEEs, regular updates are not optional, they are a must.

Here's a non-exhaustive list of all the ideas that we have to make this document richer:

- **Appendices** with extended references, examples, and supporting material
- **Deep dives into additional TEE infrastructure providers** (beyond AWS Nitro and dStack)
- **Platform recommendations** tied to specific protocol requirements and risk profiles
- **Security-first hybrid architectures**, including but not limited to:
  - ZK + TEEs
  - TEEs + MPC
  - ZK + TEEs + MPC
  - TEEs + FHE
- **Post-mortems of TEE vulnerabilities**, based on:
  - Real-world exploits and incident write-ups
  - Findings from blockchain audit reports and production failures

The long-term intention is for this guide to evolve into a **community-maintained reference** for practical TEE security in Web3: reviewed, challenged, and improved by engineers who are actively deploying and operating TEE systems.

This document will soon be open-sourced, and contributions from all interested parties will be welcomed.
